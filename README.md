# check_norris_test
A Flutter test project is showcased here, demonstrating the integration of various tools: go_router for navigation, riverpod for state management, chopper for API integration, and drift for SQLite database handling.

The application leverages the Chuck Norris API available at https://api.chucknorris.io/.

Users have access to several features, including browsing joke categories, viewing random jokes within categories, and searching for specific jokes. Additionally, users can add jokes to their favorites list and remove them as desired.

## Getting Started
Download apk called app-release.apk to check the application.
